        Petite Gardens is a community-driven project focused on transforming small spaces into vibrant, 
        sustainable gardens. Whether it's a balcony, backyard, or windowsill, we believe every square foot has the potential to bloom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to inspire and empower individuals, especially urban dwellers,
         to cultivate their own green spaces—no matter how small. Through workshops, resources, and local collaborations, 
         Petite Gardens promotes eco-conscious living and community resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us as we reimagine gardening for the modern world—one petite garden at a time.
